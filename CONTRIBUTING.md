# Contributing to this guideline

This guideline reflects what I learned from the state of the art conferences and workshops in AI, not my experience as an open source maintainer. 

If you think something important is missing or should be different based on your experience, I'd love to hear it! If you have suggestions for improving this guideline, please open an issue on the project.
